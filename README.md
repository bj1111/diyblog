## How to Install and Run the Project
To get this repository, run the following command inside your git enabled terminal.
```
$ git clone 
```

Before installing the required packages, it is recommended to create a `virtual environment`.

If you don't have the `virtual environment` installed:
```
$ python -m pip install virtualenv
```

Create the Virtual Environment: Run the following command, replacing `env` with the name you want for your environment:

```
$ python -m venv env
```

Activate the Virtual Environment: To activate the environment, use:

  + Windows:
    ```
    env\scripts\activate
    ```
  
  + Mac:
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
Deactivate the Virtual Environment: When you're done working, you can deactivate the environment with:
```
deactivate
```


After installing and activating the `virtual environment`, run the following command to install all required packages.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Use the Project
In the same directory where `manage.py` is located, run this command to start the server.
```
$ py manage.py runserver
```
Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and click `Sign up` or `Login` in the navigation bar.

The default superuser is:
+ username = _admin_
